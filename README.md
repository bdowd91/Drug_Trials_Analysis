Pymaceuticals observations

The tumor changes over a 45-day treatment for each drug were significant. The lowest percent change of the volume of the tumor was a decrease of 19 percent. This change was with Capomulin. Additionally, only one other drug decreased the volume of the tumor. That drug was Ramicane. _See Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment (Fig. 4).

Eight of the ten drugs did not decrease the tumor volume. The only drugs that decreased the tumor volume were Capomulin and Ramicane. Although, the tumor volume percent decrease for Capomulin and Ramicane were much lower than the tumor volume percent increase for the other drugs. _See Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment (Fig. 4).

The survival rate during treatment for Capomulin and Ramicane was significantly greater than the other drugs. Overall, Capomulin and Ramicane outperformed the other drugs tested in all four analyses. _See Survival Rate During Treatment (Fig. 3).
